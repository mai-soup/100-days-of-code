# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: Wednesday, March 15, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Spent most of the day applying for jobs and revising my CV now that I am out of university to better reflect my achievements as a developer, not academic ones. Nevertheless, did a few hours of coding - signed up to Frontend Mentor, completed one challenge and started another.

**Thoughts:** Getting more comfortable with Tailwind. Some of the "shortened" class names still trip me up every time, e.g. how the `align-items` property corresponds to the `items-` classes, not `align-`, but I'm sure with more practice this problem will go away. Could make bash aliases for creating a new Vite project and installing Tailwind dependencies, since I'm going to be using those two a lot, so might as well save some typing.

### Day 7: Tuesday, March 14, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Attempted to make the Hangman game's design responsive so the game is all visible on smaller screen sizes. Ran into a problem with the image refusing to shrink past its original size, spent a few hours trying to find a bug in my code, since with a `div` the flexbox worked properly. Turns out I hadn't exactly made a mistake in my code, I just wasn't aware of [a default setting in flexbox regarding minimum size](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36247448). I couldn't find this information initially because I was focused on the `img` element specifically and not on minimum size in flexbox in general.

**Thoughts:** Debugging is a lot more difficult without a more senior dev to ask for an opinion after hitting a wall doing it alone. I tried asking for help on a Discord community after a couple hours of fiddling around, but received no response - can't figure out why. Wish there was someone I could text directly when running into things like this, but oh well. Google and extra time spent will have to do for now.

### Day 6: Monday, March 13, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Implemented the base functionality for the Hangman app, added some styling. Need to ensure it's responsive, as well as add the option to play using keyboard input.

**Thoughts:** Had a weird bug where a change to a `Set` in state wouldn't cause the children to update until a hot reload? Fixed by using an array instead, but will have to look if it's intended or if I messed something up.

### Days 4-5: March 10-11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Polish up the app, fix known bugs, all that's left is to address design problems in mobile (it's functional and responsive, but the logo looks a bit weird and the "copied" text appears somewhere offscreen.

**Thoughts:** React is actually a lot more fun to work with than I imagined it would be.
