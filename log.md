# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Days 4-5: March 10-11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Polish up the app, fix known bugs, all that's left is to address design problems in mobile (it's functional and responsive, but the logo looks a bit weird and the "copied" text appears somewhere offscreen.

**Thoughts:** React is actually a lot more fun to work with than I imagined it would be.
