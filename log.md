# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: Monday, March 13, 2023

**Today's Progress:** Implemented the base functionality for the Hangman app, added some styling. Need to ensure it's responsive, as well as add the option to play using keyboard input.

**Thoughts:** Had a weird bug where a change to a `Set` in state wouldn't cause the children to update until a hot reload? Fixed by using an array instead, but will have to look if it's intended or if I messed something up.

### Days 4-5: March 10-11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Polish up the app, fix known bugs, all that's left is to address design problems in mobile (it's functional and responsive, but the logo looks a bit weird and the "copied" text appears somewhere offscreen.

**Thoughts:** React is actually a lot more fun to work with than I imagined it would be.
